    " The Summit has benefited me in so many ways. There were members and friends that helped me find the right 
    classes to take every semester. The Summit also provided a support system for anyone who were going through 
    tough situations in and out of school. Study sessions for student were also created to help students progress
    in their classes. Not only were study sessions held but we had guest speakers come to talk to us about self
    improvement when it came to finances and personal health. We also made time to also enjoy each otherâ€™s company
    outside of school whether it was playing sports at the ODU gym or going to the movies. This environment helped 
    me grow and improve as a student and a man. The relationship I built with Dr. Kevin Muchiri and all the members 
    in the Summit has really shaped the person I am today. Being apart of the Summit for the past 5 years gave me 
    memories and great moments that I will cherish for a lifetime." <br/><br/>

  <p> " Being a member of the summit helped me find my feet at old dominion University when I first go there.
  It gave me the opportunit to meet friends who were willing to put in the effort and do what it takes
  to be successful and so that made me work harder. The friendliness and mentorship of the leaders motivated
  me alot. I'm glad to have been a member of the summit. "<br/><br/>

  <p>" Being a part of the Summit has been a blessing that I intend to share with others. As a freshman, I came into 
  college with an unstable mindset and no direction on where my future would be. I had no idea that a simple 
  invitation to join what was then a little study group, would have molded me into the man I am today. I was 
  invited to join not a group, but a family that built me ground-up in the areas of confidence and virtues. 
  Knowing there are students out there who can have a chance at an amazing college experience through the Summit 
  honestly brings me immense joy. I currently hold a job as engineer in the industry and am able to display the 
  professionalism, work ethic, and wisdom that the Summit engraved in me. " <br/><br/>
